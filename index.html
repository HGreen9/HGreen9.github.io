<h1>
    Hannah Green
</h1>

  <p>
    My name is Hannah, and I am in my third year of college studying Visual Communications Design at Eastern Washington. I love crafting and enjoy making things by hand and digitally. I have lived in Spokane my entire life and plan to stay here for a while as I continue my education and build my portfolio. My ultimate goal is to pursue a career in inclusive design, creating designs that cater to a wide range of people, including those with disabilities, but also for minorities to increase positive representation. I want to normalize human differences and break societal norms.
