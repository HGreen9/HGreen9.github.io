<h1>
    Hannah Green
</h1>

  <p>
    My name is Hannah, and I'm a senior studying Visual Communications Design at Eastern Washington University, currently earning certificates in User Experience and Front End Web Design. A lifelong Spokane resident, I’m passionate about crafting—both by hand and digitally—and I’m committed to building a meaningful, inclusive career right here in my community. My mission is to create designs that bridge functionality and artistry, blending nature-inspired craftsmanship with modern aesthetics. I aim to evoke emotion, tell stories, and build authentic connections through detailed, thoughtful design. My portfolio reflects a dedication to high-quality, inclusive, and sustainable solutions that celebrate human differences and challenge societal norms. Ultimately, I hope to pursue a career in inclusive design that increases positive representation for marginalized communities, including people with disabilities and minorities.
